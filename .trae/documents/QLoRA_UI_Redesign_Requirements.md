# QLoRA Fine-Tuning Pipeline - Modern UI/UX Redesign Requirements

## 1. Product Overview

This project involves a complete redesign of the QLoRA Fine-Tuning Pipeline frontend interface, transforming it into a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing application that follows current UX/UI best practices while preserving all existing functionality.

The redesigned interface will serve data scientists, ML engineers, and researchers who need to fine-tune language models without deep ML expertise. The new design will streamline workflows, improve accessibility, and provide a more engaging user experience.

Target: Create a best-in-class ML workflow interface that reduces learning curve by 40% and improves task completion rates by 60%.

## 3. Core Process

**Primary ML Workflow:**
Users start on the Dashboard to get an overview of their workspace. They navigate to Fine-tune to upload datasets and configure training parameters through a guided interface. After launching training, they monitor progress in Activity. Once complete, they test the model in Playground, run evaluations to measure performance, and finally use Publish to prepare the model for deployment.

**Secondary Workflows:**
- **Quick Testing**: Dashboard → Playground (for existing models)
- **Batch Evaluation**: Dashboard → Evaluation → Results Dashboard
- **Model Management**: Dashboard → Publish → Adapter Manager
